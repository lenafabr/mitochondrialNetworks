# mitochondrialNetworks
Code for simulating dynamic networks of fusing and fissing spherocylindrical units, representing mitochondrial networks. Spreading of diffusive material within the networks is included.

Please see the README.pdf under doc/ for an explanation of how to set up, run, and perform basic analysis on the simulation code and its output.

Make sure to download the repository at:
https://github.com/lenafabr/networktools
and add networktools to your path in MATLAB (necessary for analysis, not for running the simulation).
